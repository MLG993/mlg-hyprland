# MLG-Hyprland

This is my Hyprland config it is very basic and does all i need it to do!

## Dependencies

-> YAY (because i like go):

      yay -S hyprland-git fuzzel-git waybar-git alacritty-git

-> Pacman (update):

      sudo pacman -Syu

-> Pacman (depencies, recomendations)

      sudo pacman -S pipewire thunar gdm zsh

Feel free in using a different display manager i just like gdm. Since I've used nautilus
you will need to change it in the hyprland.conf (~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf).

-> oh-my-zsh:

      sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

This is my oh-my-zsh Theme:
